			First off I LOVE CARS! No, not the movies. Just Kidding it was cars, especially Mater he's my favorite. I love fast and sporty cars, supercars more specifically.
			One day I want to own some type of supercar like a Cheetah print Lamborghini.

			I'm a small town guy from Idaho, Mr. Potato Head is my hero. Itake him everywhere I go. We spent a lot of time on the mountain snowboarding.

			I also really enjoy camping and being in the outdoors. During the summer time my friends, Mr. Potato Head and I would
			disappear into the hills and listen to music, hike, drink, smoke, and party.
